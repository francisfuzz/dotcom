This site is based on [`11ty/eleventy-base-blog`](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). I originally used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but moved over to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) because I wanted to try something new.

Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/francisfuzz/francisb.me/pull/13) that showcases all of the changes.

Onwards and upwards. ðŸš€
