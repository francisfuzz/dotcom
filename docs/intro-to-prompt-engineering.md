## Notes

- Why
    - Important for research, discoveries, and advancement
    - Helps to test and evaluate the limitations of LLMs
    - Enables all kinds of innovative applications
- First basic prompt: “The sky is blue”
    - Model
    - Temperature
    - top-p
- Elements of a prompt
    - Instructions — neutral / negative / positive
    - Context
    - Input data
    - Output indicator (sentiment)
- Settings to keep in mind
    - Get different results with prompts when using different settings
    - Controlling how deterministic the model is when generating completion for prompts
    - Temperature and top_p are two important parameters to keep in mind
    - Generally, keep these low if you arel ooking for exact answers
    - Keep them high if you are looking for more diverse responses
- Designing prompts for different tasks
    - Text Summarization
    - Question Answering
    - Text Classification
    - Role Playing
    - Code Generation
    - Reasoning
