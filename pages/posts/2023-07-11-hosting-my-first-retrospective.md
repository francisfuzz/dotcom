I hosted my team's quarterly retrospective. This article covers what I did to prepare and execute it, along with a reflection that serves as my own retrospective of how it went.

## Preparation

Initially, I reviewed our team's guidelines. We have our own version of the [What Went Well Retrospective](https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/whatwentwell-whatdidntgowell) format along with specific timestamps using [Stickies.io](https://stickies.io/). The guidelines offered enough detail for how they're conducted, but there wasn't enough context provided to help me get into the "right mindset" for preparing to be a moderator.

I asked for help in one of our sibling team channels and my previous manager offered to help me understand her framework for preparation. I immediately accepted her offer and we jumped right in!

The five things that I learned in our conversation:

- Being really clear with myself will allow me to lead others well.
- Using action-oriented prompts can help direct the conversation in a forward momentum.
- Anonymous inputs help for participants to speak more freely, removing the barrier for people who may not be able to speak in the moment.
- One of the major responsibilities of being a moderator is about timing: knowing when to wrap up a topic, keeping the conversation flowing, soliciting feedback from participants who haven't contributed yet, and keeping an eye on the clock are critical.
- Make and carve space for others to speak using silence. If there are more "chatty" participants who are eager to speak first, allow them to say what they need to say, and prompt the room by politely saying "I'd love to hear from others that haven't participated yet" or another variation.

## Execution

I had three "sheets" in my Stickies.io board:

- A card for the prime directive and the agenda
- Last Retro's Action Items
- The retro's four columns: Continue, Start, Stop, and Kudos -- I later created an `Action Items` sticky note for after the meeting.
