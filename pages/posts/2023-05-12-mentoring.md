# Mentoring

I'm reading a book called Helping Others Win: 10 Keys To Effective Mentoring by Kenneth Mulkey.

In the foreword, it's written:

"A mentor doesn't have to fix people or tell them what to do or not to do. The greatest mentors are great listeners who tell you who you are and what you can be."

I'm letting these two sentences sit in my spirit for the rest of the day.
