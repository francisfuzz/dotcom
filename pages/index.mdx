üëã Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub working on [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).

Previously, I worked on GitHub Discussions along with prototyping an internationalized and localized version of GitHub.com to expand the platform's language offerings beyond English. As a developer myself, I know how important it is to have access to resources in your native language, and I'm passionate about making sure engineers all over the world can benefit from our platform. üó∫Ô∏è

I joined GitHub in 2015 as a Support Engineer, where I helped customers troubleshoot issues and optimize their use of our API, integrations, and devops features. Since then, I've worked brief stints in program management and partner engineering roles, where I focused on improving content localization for GitHub Docs and fostering a thriving GitHub Community. ü´Ç

Creating a positive and inclusive work environment is essential to doing great work. I'm a big believer in learning in public, pair programming, and keeping it classy. I actively work to create "brave spaces" where my team and I can thrive and grow together. ‚ú®
