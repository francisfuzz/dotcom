👋 Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub working on the New User Experience team, where we build features that help developers discover and love GitHub. ✨

Recently, our team collaborated with GitHub's Authentication team to implement social sign-in, which contributed to a 40% month-over-month increase in developer signups—making it easier than ever for new users to join our community. I work alongside talented colleagues to design and run growth experiments that help customers unlock the full potential of GitHub Copilot, and contribute as an Incident Commander to keep GitHub reliable and available for millions of developers worldwide.

Previously, I worked on GitHub Education, GitHub Discussions, and internationalizing GitHub's products. I joined GitHub in 2015 as a Support Engineer, where I advised customers to make the most of their GitHub workflow, optimizing usage of the GitHub API, integrations, and devops features. Since then, I've worked brief stints in program management and partner engineering roles, where I focused on improving content localization for GitHub Docs and fostering a thriving GitHub Community.

Creating a positive and inclusive work environment is essential to doing great work. I'm a big believer in learning in public, pair programming, and keeping it classy. I actively work to create "brave spaces" where my team and I can thrive and grow together.
