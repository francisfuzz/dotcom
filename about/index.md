I'm a Senior Partner Engineer for the Global Expansion & Partnerships team at [GitHub](https://github.com), the world's largest software development network. My most valued work practices are establishing trust, exercising curiosity, and creating a brave space to learn and solve problems together.

Previously, I worked as a program manager and a technical support engineer helping customers with <a href="https://github.community/u/francisfuzz/activity/solved" target="_blank">technical advice</a> for making the most out of GitHub's platform features.

I made this website to capture what I'm learning and sharing it with the world to encourage and empower readers like you my writing by [buying me a nigiri üç£ ](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/francisfuzz). If you'd like to connect, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francis-b).
