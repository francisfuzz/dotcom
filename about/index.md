Francis is Senior Partner Engineer for the Special Projects at [GitHub](https://github.com), the world's largest software development platform. Previously, as one of the lead Software Engineers for the Global Expansion & Partnerships team, he focused on improving content localization for [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en), and as a Senior Program Manager for the [GitHub Community](https://github.community/), he advocated for customer needs internally and empowered them with <a href="https://github.community/u/francisfuzz/activity/solved" target="_blank">technical advice</a> for making the most out of GitHub's platform features. 

His most valued work practices are establishing and building trust in every interaction and creating a brave space to learn and solve problems with teammates and customers alike.

He made this website to capture what he's learning and sharing it with the world to encourage readers (like you!). You're welcome to support his writing by [buying him a nigiri](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/francisfuzz).
